# nfl-bdb-completion-probability
This project analyzes a simulated NFL player-tracking dataset designed to approximate receiver–defender spatial dynamics. The dataset includes a modeled completion probability, which is used as the outcome variable to study how movement, spacing, and play context influence pass success likelihood.

Project Question: How do early post-snap spatial dynamics influence modeled completion probability?
